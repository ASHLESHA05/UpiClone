Below is a professional, beautiful, and well-structured README for your GitHub repository. It reflects your project as a UPI (Unified Payments Interface) clone with three Docker containers (`bank-service`, `npci-service`, and `client`), built using the MVC architecture and adhering to SOLID and GRASP principles. Since you’re running it with `clear && mvn clean install && docker compose up --build`, I’ve tailored the instructions accordingly.

# UPI Clone

![UPI Clone Banner](https://ucarecdn.com/7cbf6f3f-7a09-4828-8b24-ab17f8a6c1b2/united_logo.png)  
*A scalable, modular simulation of India’s Unified Payments Interface (UPI) built with Java, Spring Boot, and Docker.*

---

## Overview

UPI Clone is a robust, microservices-based simulation of the Unified Payments Interface, India’s real-time payment system. This project demonstrates a distributed architecture with three core components:

1. **Bank Service**: Manages banking operations such as account creation, transactions (credit/debit), and dashboard analytics.
2. **NPCI Service**: Simulates the National Payments Corporation of India’s role as the payment gateway, routing transactions between banks.
3. **Client**: The user-facing application, enabling seamless interaction with the UPI ecosystem (e.g., sending payments, checking balances).

Each component runs in its own Docker container, orchestrated via Docker Compose, ensuring isolation, scalability, and ease of deployment. The system is built using **Spring Boot** with an **MVC (Model-View-Controller)** architecture, adhering to **SOLID** and **GRASP** principles for maintainability and extensibility.

---

## Features

- **Bank Service**:
    - User authentication and role-based access (ADMIN, USER).
    - Account management (create accounts, generate ATM cards, set PINs).
    - Transaction processing (credit/debit) with real-time balance updates.
    - Admin dashboard with visualizations (pie charts, bar graphs, line charts) using Chart.js.

- **NPCI Service**:
    - Transaction routing between banks.
    - Validation of UPI requests and responses.
    - Centralized logging and monitoring.

- **Client**:
    - Intuitive UI for initiating UPI payments.
    - Real-time transaction status updates.
    - Secure communication with NPCI and bank services.

- **Architecture**:
    - Microservices deployed as Docker containers.
    - MongoDB for persistent storage.
    - RESTful APIs for inter-service communication.

## Prerequisites

- **Java 17+**: Ensure JDK is installed.
- **Maven**: For building the project (`mvn` command).
- **Docker**: For containerization.
- **Docker Compose**: For multi-container orchestration.
- **MongoDB**: Running locally or in a container (configured in `docker-compose.yml`).

---

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/upi-clone.git
cd upi-clone
```

### 2. Build and Run
Use the provided command to clean, build, and start all services:
```bash
clear && mvn clean install && docker compose up --build
```

- **`clear`**: Clears the terminal (Unix-based systems; omit on Windows or replace with `cls`).
- **`mvn clean install`**: Builds all Maven projects (`bank-service`, `npci-service`, `client`).
- **`docker compose up --build`**: Builds and starts the Docker containers.

### 3. Access the Services
Once running, access the components:
- **Client**: `http://localhost:8080` (Main UPI interface).
- **Bank Service**: `http://localhost:8081/[bank]/dashboard` (e.g., `/camera/dashboard`).
- **NPCI Service**: Internal routing (exposed via logs or API endpoints).

### 4. Stop the Services
```bash
docker compose down
```

---

## Docker Compose Configuration

The `docker-compose.yml` file orchestrates the three services and MongoDB:

```yaml
version: '3.8'
services:
  bank-service:
    build: ./bank-service
    ports:
      - "8081:8081"
    depends_on:
      - mongodb
    environment:
      - SPRING_DATA_MONGODB_URI=mongodb://mongodb:27017/bankdb

  npci-service:
    build: ./npci-service
    ports:
      - "8082:8082"
    depends_on:
      - mongodb
    environment:
      - SPRING_DATA_MONGODB_URI=mongodb://mongodb:27017/npcidb

  client:
    build: ./client
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"
    depends_on:
      - bank-service
      - npci-service

  mongodb:
    image: mongo:latest
    ports:
      - "27017:27017"
    volumes:
      - mongo-data:/data/db

volumes:
  mongo-data:
```

---

## Usage

1. **Register a User**: Sign up via the client UI or bank service (`/[bank]/signup`).
2. **Create an Account**: As a USER, create an account via `/[bank]/createAccount`.
3. **Perform Transactions**: Use the client to initiate UPI payments, routed through NPCI to the bank.
4. **Admin Dashboard**: Log in as an ADMIN to view transaction analytics (`/[bank]/dashboard`).

---

## Design Principles

- **SOLID**:
    - **Single Responsibility**: Each service handles one concern (e.g., banking, routing, UI).
    - **Open/Closed**: Extensible via new bank services without modifying NPCI.
    - **Liskov Substitution**: Interchangeable bank implementations.
    - **Interface Segregation**: Specific interfaces for each service’s needs.
    - **Dependency Inversion**: High-level modules depend on abstractions.

- **GRASP**:
    - **Controller**: `BankUIController` manages user requests.
    - **Information Expert**: `AccountService` handles account logic.
    - **Low Coupling**: Services communicate via REST APIs.
    - **High Cohesion**: Each service focuses on its domain.
